                    <h4>Types of knitting needles</h4>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Straight - for any project</li>
                        <li>Circular - for knitting in round or for holding a large amount of stitches; works great for hats, for example, or blankets!</li>
                        <li>Double-pointed  - for knitting in square, for example, for socks</li>
                    </ol>

                        <ledend>Our advise</ledend>
                        <p>Start with the straight needles - easy to handle, suitable for almost any project, more affordable. Good choice all around.</p>

                    <ol>
                        <li>bamboo</li>
                        <li>metal</li>
                        <li>plastic</li>

                        <ledend>Our advise</ledend>
                        <p>Choose what you like the most! Go to a local store and try and feel both types. Some people like the “soft” touch of bamboo, others prefer how smoothly yarn slides over the metal needles. So, we encourage you to find out what works for you!</p>

                    <h4>Sizes of knitting needles</h4>
                    <p>The size of knitting needles varies from 2 mm to 25mm.</p>
                    <p>Usually the size of knitting needles is defined by the project itself or the  final result you are going for. For example, sizes 0-1 are perfect for laces, 1-3 for socks, 11-17 for a bulky blanket or a cardigan. Refer to a guide below to have a better understanding of knitting needle sizes!</p>

                        <p>size 6, 7 or 8. Accurate knitting needle size is very important for any project. This will essentially determine how fine your stitches are going to be. If you just start, we recommend getting just 1 pair of knitting needles in size 6, 7, or 8. These are good medium options to get your hands and fingers used to knitting without putting too much tension on them.</p>

                    <p>Yarns can go in different materials, textures, colors, and weights. All these details are usually displayed on the yarn’s label.</p>
                    <p>Yarn material, color and texture are pretty straightforward characteristics. The one that might be a bit confusing even for pros is yarn weight. Let’s break it down.</p>
                    
                    <article>
                    <h4>Yarn weight</h4>
                    <p>Yarn weight refers to the thickness of the yarn. It's a range, from super fine to super bulky.</p>
                    <p>Below is a great chart that shows all the types of yarn weight, what projects that can be used for and what size of knitting needles work best for each.</p>

                        <p>medium weight, any material or color, but make sure you LOVE it. It’s the most fun part - to be able to choose the color, style and design of your project. Besides, this will encourage you to keep going, and learn more and practise more. </p>

                    <p>Hope we haven’t bored you or, worse, scared you with the amount of information. It is much better to be aware of all the characteristics above before you start your first project. Right tools and materials are big parts of a successful project, so star forming your understanding of these fundamental concepts early on seems like a very good idea. And even if it doesn’t make much sense at the moment, don’t worry, it will click eventually.</p> 
                    <p>With that, let's move on to the next step!</p>

                    <p>All knitting starts with casting on. This creates loops on the needle which will become the first row of stitches.</p>
